# Jeopardy Game

This is a simple web-based Jeopardy game where players can test their knowledge across various categories. This application was created as part of my final project for the graduate course Web Application Development (CS-412), where this course served as an inroduction to different techniques 
and tools for the design of web applications. Topics covered include web applications flow, object oriented programming,
design of classes, dynamic content, scripting languages, implicit objects, and database accessing. Where we were expected to understand and apply these concepts into the generation of sample websites.

The web application was deployed on the NEIU (Northeastern Illinois University) server. During deployment, all files were organized in a simple and accessible manner, without separating them into different folders. 
This means that all the files required for the web application to run were placed in the same directory or location without any further organization. The reason for this approach might have been to streamline the deployment process and make it easier to access and manage the files. By keeping all files in one place, it simplifies navigation and reduces the complexity of the project structure, especially during initial development and deployment phases.
However, I hope to reorganize the project files in the near future.
